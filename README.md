A repo for javascript
Great! Here’s an updated version with more specific context:


This repository documents my journey as I learn JavaScript, focusing on both foundational concepts and practical projects. I’m currently exploring:
	•	Variables, data types, and operators
	•	 Functions and scope
	•	 Arrays and objects
	•	 Loops and conditionals
	•	DOM manipulation
	•	 ES6 features (let/const, arrow functions, template literals)
	•	 Coming up: Async/Await, Promises, and APIs

Most of the code here comes from hands-on practice, mini-projects, and exercises based on online tutorials and courses. My goal is to not only write functional code but also understand why it works.

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or reach out if you’re on a similar path. Let’s grow together!
